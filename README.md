## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Guide

background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
```
Replace `#667eea` and `#764ba2` with your preferred colors.
- Use color pickers: https://colorhunt.co/ or https://coolors.co/

### Adding More Countries:

1. Find the `cultures` array in the JavaScript section
2. Add a new country object following this template:
```javascript
{
    name: "Country Name",
    emoji: "üè¥", // Find flag emojis at emojipedia.org
    score: 0,
    color: "#hexcolor",
    traits: ["Trait 1", "Trait 2", "Trait 3"],
    matches: {
        "answer-value": 3, // 3 = strong match, 2 = moderate, 1 = weak
    },
    sliderPreferences: { 1: 5, 6: 7 } // Question index: ideal value
}
```

### Modifying Questions:

Find the `questions` array and add/edit questions:
```javascript
{
    question: "Your question text?",
    type: "multiple", // or "slider"
    options: [
        { text: "Answer option", value: "answer-value" }
    ]
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: File opens showing code instead of the app
**Solution**: Make sure the file is saved with `.html` extension, not `.txt`

### Problem: Buttons or sliders not working
**Solution**: 
- Try a different browser
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings
- Check that you copied ALL the code (from `<!DOCTYPE html>` to `</html>`)

### Problem: Layout looks broken
**Solution**: 
- Use a modern browser (update if needed)
- Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check zoom level is at 100%

### Problem: Can't save the file as HTML
**Solution for Mac TextEdit**:
- Go to TextEdit ‚Üí Preferences
- Under "Format", select "Plain text"
- Uncheck "Add .txt extension to plain text files"

**Solution for Windows**:
- When saving in Notepad, change "Save as type" to "All Files (*.*)"
- Type the full name including extension: `cultural-match-assessment.html`

## üìä Understanding the Algorithm

The app calculates cultural matches based on:

1. **Multiple Choice Answers** (weighted 1-3 points):
   - Strong alignment = 3 points
   - Moderate alignment = 2 points  
   - Weak alignment = 1 point

2. **Slider Values** (0-10 points):
   - Calculates difference from culture's ideal value
   - Closer to ideal = more points

3. **Final Score**:
   - Combines all points
   - Converts to percentage relative to highest scoring culture
   - Displays top 3 matches
